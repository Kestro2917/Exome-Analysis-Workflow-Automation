Exome Analysis Workflow Automation: A GUI-Based Integrated Computational Tool for Cancer Genome Analysis

Bikram Sahoo, Georgia State University

Cancer is a genetically complex disease, requiring intensive computational procedures to extract meaningful insights from genome data. Each cancer genome dataset presents unique challenges, necessitating diverse analytical strategies. To address this, we have developed the Exome Analysis Workflow Automationâ€”a fully automated GUI-based computational pipeline.

Exome Analysis Workflow Automation integrates various tools, including BWA, Picard, GATK, and MuTect, for detecting somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels. It refines analyses through filtration of low coverage variants, removal of variants from public databases, recurrence calculation, and variant annotation using oncotator. For copy number alteration analysis, the pipeline incorporates Control-FREEC, DNAcopy, and GISTIC.

Designed for broad applicability, Exome Analysis Workflow Automation offers a user-friendly interface, allowing computational and non-computational researchers to analyze cancer genomes with statistical rigor and automation. With a simple click, users can execute analytical modules seamlessly.

An early analysis using datasets from various human cancer cell lines demonstrates the versatility and automation capabilities of this tool in analyzing high-throughput datasets.
